## SMORT - Sudoku Meets Optimized Recursive Traversal

# About The Project

This is a program that runs in the terminal. The user can put input to fill in the sudoku grid and then proceed to have it solved either instantly or slowly to get a visualization of the process to have a better understanding. We can think as if the solution is hidden in a search tree. The backtracking algorithm traverses this search tree recursively in depth-first order. This is much more efficient than bruteforcing, which would take a very long time even on the latest and finest computers due to the nature of sudoku puzzles and how many possibilities there are.

# Prerequisites

You have to have rust readily installed on your system. It is highly recommended to use rustup for installing rust. You can find more details on how to install rust on your system [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

# Compilation

You can compile the program simply by running
```
cargo build
```

# Usage

After having compiled the program, you either manually execute the binary or run
```
cargo run
```
